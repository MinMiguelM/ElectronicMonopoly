# ElectronicMonopoly
A distributed application in Android. It helps you to manage your financial information in the game "Monopoly".
 This application is a support and it has not all information about the game.

# Setup
First of all, the server side (Bank) has to be running in the same network. The bank is a stand-alone application and it can be 
found at: https://github.com/MinMiguelM/MonopolyBank.git. <br>
The bank is in Spanish, therefore it is necessary that you know some about it.

# Running
When the APP is running, the first screen takes two inputs:
* Host: the IP address where the server side is hosted. By default is: 10.42.0.1
* Name: a nickname that allows to identify a player.

# Future work
* Identifying available hosts.
